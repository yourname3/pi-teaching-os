curcpu/curtask: we should be able to use gcc -ffixed-reg and then just reserve a register
to always point to curcpu.

apparently there are ldtr and sttr instructions that can be used to load/store "as if"
in el0. we could change our setup like so:
- identity map the entire 48 bit address space in ttrb0_el0
- require use of copyin/copyout to access userspace--implemented using these ldtr and
  sdtr instructions.
